                <h3>ICS 111</h3>
            <p>This course is an overview of the fundamentals of computer science emphasizing problem solving, algorithm development, implementation, and debugging/testing using an object-oriented programming language.</p>
            <p>This course used Java as the programming language.  The course required the use of jGrasp for the entire semester: <a href="http://www.jgrasp.org/" target="_top">JGrasp Website</a></p>
            <p>Github respository for code example: <a href="https://github.com/BradBKai/BookStoreArray">BookStore</a></p>
            <p>This project required utilizing arraylists, methods(constructor, toString, accessor and mutator), and exceptions. The primary challenge was to understand how each class worked with each other.</p>
            <p>Please note: BookStore is a stand alone project focusing on arraylists.  BookStore2.java was created by the instructor. However, in order to see the Book and BookException files work, BookStore2 is required.</p>

            <h3>ICS 211</h3>
            <p>This course reinforces and strengthens problem-solving skills using abstract data types and introduce software development practices. Emphasize the use of searching and sorting algorithms and their complexity, recursion, object-oriented programming, and data structures.
            <p>The following files below emphasized creating code that uses existing files provided by the professor.  These projects provided experience with working with or modifying existing code as would be the case in real world environments. </p>
            <p>Github repository for code example one: <a href='https://github.com/BradBKai/SortArrayExample'>Sort Array Example</a></p>
            <p>This project required initializing and storing information from the file input.txt into an array then sorting the information.  </p>
            <p>Github repository for code example two: <a href='https://github.com/BradBKai/CompareToExample'>CompareTo Example</a></p>
            <p>This project required initializing and storing information from the file compass.csv into an array, comparing values, and modifying data in the array.  Each part required the output be posted.  This project required the professor's file sorting.java. </p>

        <h3>ICS 110</h3>
        <p>ICS 110 placed an emphasis on flowcharting, documentation techniques to create android mobile applications.</p>
        <p>This course utilized MIT's App Inventor Built-in Blocks: <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/support/blocks.html" target="_top">MIT App Inventor Website</a>
        <p>Github repository for code example: <a href="https://github.com/BradBKai/ConcentrationGame" target="_top">Concentration Game!</a></p>
        <p>This featured project was the final for the course.  The challenges required to figure out to program cards to interact with each other.  If the picture is not the same or same, the next step would to flip the cards back or hide the cards from gameplay.</p>
